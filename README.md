# AWS Glue Examples

AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy for analytics users to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources. You can use it for analytics, machine learning, and application development. It also includes additional productivity and data ops tooling for authoring, running jobs, and implementing business workflows.

With AWS Glue, you can discover and connect to more than 70 diverse data sources and manage your data in a centralized data catalog. You can visually create, run, and monitor extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines to load data into your data lakes. Also, you can immediately search and query cataloged data using Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

AWS Glue consolidates major data integration capabilities into a single service. These include data discovery, modern ETL, cleansing, transforming, and centralized cataloging. It's also serverless, which means there's no infrastructure to manage. With flexible support for all workloads like ETL, ELT, and streaming in one service, AWS Glue supports users across various workloads and types of users.

Also, AWS Glue makes it easy to integrate data across your architecture. It integrates with AWS analytics services and Amazon S3 data lakes. AWS Glue has integration interfaces and job-authoring tools that are easy to use for all users, from developers to business users, with tailored solutions for varied technical skill sets.

With the ability to scale on demand, AWS Glue helps you focus on high-value activities that maximize the value of your data. It scales for any data size, and supports all data types and schema variances. To increase agility and optimize costs, AWS Glue provides built-in high availability and pay-as-you-go billing.
